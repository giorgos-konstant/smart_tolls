How to debug and run Flutter Web Apps with VS Code:

1) Follow instructions from here:
https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/windows/web

2) Run "flutter doctor" to make sure it finds the chrome installation
3) Run "flutter channel" to make sure you're on "stable"
4) If not on "stable" , run "flutter channel stable"
5) [Optional] run flutter upgrade
6) You can check connected devices with "flutter devices"
(e.g. chrome for web-app)

6.5) Before going to run flutter app, make sure other necessary components are running (MongoDB, docker, MQTT, fiware, backend.js)

7) Debug/Run configurations are instructed in .vscode folder of the smart_tolls repo
Go to "Run and Debug" (left toolbar in VS code) and choose:
    > Flutter Web (HTML Rendered) for user app
    > Flutter Web Admin for admin app
Specifically "launch.json" contains the configurations

8) Press the Green Play Button on top of the Run and Debug page
(More instructions: https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/web/building)
